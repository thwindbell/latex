USAGE:

\bibliographystyle{mybstfile}
\bibliography{IEEEabrv,mybibfile}

where the IEEE titles in the .bib database entries use the strings
defined here. e.g.,


   journal = IEEE_J_AC,


to yield "{IEEE} Trans. Automat. Contr."


IEEE uses abbreviated journal titles in their bibliographies -
this file is suitable for work that is to be submitted to the IEEE.


For work that requires full-length titles, you should use the full
titles provided in the companion file, IEEEfull.bib.


** NOTES **

 1. Journals have been grouped according to subject in order to make it
    easier to locate and extract the definitions for related journals - 
    as most works use references that are confined to a single topic.
    Magazines are listed in straight alphabetical order.

 2. String names are closely based on IEEE's own internal acronyms.
 
 3. Abbreviations follow IEEE's style.

 4. Older, out-of-print IEEE titles are included (but not including titles
    dating prior to IEEE's formation from the IRE and AIEE in 1963).

 5. The following NEW/current journal definitions have been disabled because
    their abbreviations have not yet been verified:
    
    STRING{IEEE_J_CBB        = "{IEEE/ACM} Trans. Comput. Biology Bioinformatics"}
    STRING{IEEE_J_CJECE      = "Canadian J. Elect. Comput. Eng."}
    STRING{IEEE_J_DSC        = "{IEEE} Trans. Dependable Secure Comput."}
    STRING{IEEE_O_DSO        = "{IEEE} Distrib. Syst. Online"}
    
 6. The following OLD journal definitions have been disabled because
    their abbreviations have not yet been found/verified:

    STRING{IEEE_J_BCTV       = "{IEEE} Trans. Broadcast Television Receivers"}
    STRING{IEEE_J_EWS        = "{IEEE} Trans. Eng. Writing Speech"}

If you know what the proper abbreviation is for a string in #5 or #6 above,
email me and I will correct them in the next release.
